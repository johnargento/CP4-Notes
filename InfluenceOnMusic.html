   <div> <b> 1) Hip-hop in the early 2000’s tended to follow a defined set of rules. The early 00’s in rap is often referred to as the ‘Bling Era’; a time when the music of the genre had to have the Timbaland sound, the lyrics glorified expensive lifestyles and nearly all artists had to uphold a tough, gangster persona in order to be taken seriously. The biggest rap artist of the time, 50 Cent, followed this formula nearly perfectly.
In this era, it seemed that there was no place for observation on topics such as religion, family, prejudice and materialism; that is until Kanye stepped into the void. Kanye’s debut album, The College Dropout, had its greatest impact in changing the rules of what a hip-hop artist has to be like. Kanye’s highly personal brand of storytelling and ability to touch on so many topics was a big departure from other hip-hop giants during his era (50 Cent, The Game, Ludacris, etc.). It let people in the mainstream see a side of rap music that focused on universal problems and thoughts, not just material desires. This perspective left a big mark on hip-hop music at the time — it popularized the concept of a socially aware rapper in the 2000's. </b> </div>
   <div class="topright"> <b> 2) With the release of 808s and Heartbreak in 2008, Kanye took his career to a new terrain, leaving behind the soul of College Dropout, the orchestration of Late Registration and the radio-friendly pop of Graduation, to embrace a cold and electronic soundscape. The music on 808s relied heavily on the use of the retro Roland TR-808 drum machine and the outright auto-tuning of Kanye’s vocals, with writer Andy Kellman stating that album featured, “[…] dense drums, lengthy strings, droning synths and somber piano.”
The use of these sounds helped to create a moody, atmospheric record that pushed the boundaries of what could be considered hip-hop. Following the album’s release, there were many interpretations of what new genre to place the album in, such as electropop, synthpop and experimental pop. Even though Kanye rapped on nearly every song, people felt uncomfortable labelling the album as a rap record, showing just how different the sound was for its time. </b> </div>
